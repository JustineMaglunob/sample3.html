			<td style="font-family: ink free;">Fun fact 😄Katkat is the daughter of our old dogs that lived in the farm and we moved her to the our home because of snake infestation🐍😡and we didn't want her to be harmed from the snakes so we had to move a lot of the puppies. Katkat was also protective of us 😎 but was also like Prilhyn and that means she was also makulit 😭 but that makes her cute also when she tries to play with our other dogs.

			</td>
			<td style="font-family: ink free"> American Bully are breed that are known for being tough and for their courage💪 but it was very trustworthy and reliable dog and an ideal dog for a family dog but if they look tuff they also have a big heart as you can see a picture of our american bully😂. </td>
